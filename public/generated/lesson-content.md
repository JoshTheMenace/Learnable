## Introduction to Rock Types  

Welcome to the first lesson in our **Geology Basics** series!  
In this section you’ll discover **what rocks are**, why they’re important, and **the three main families** they belong to. By the end you’ll be able to name a few common rocks and understand the big picture of how they form.

### What Is a Rock?  

- A **rock** is a solid aggregation of one or more minerals.  
- Unlike a single mineral (which has a specific chemical composition), a rock can be a **mix of many minerals**.  
- Rocks make up the **Earth’s crust** and are the building blocks of mountains, continents, and even the soil we plant in.

> **Fun fact:** The word “rock” comes from the Old English *rocc*, meaning “stone.”

### The Three Main Rock Families  

| Family | How It Forms | Typical Examples | Key Characteristics |
|--------|--------------|------------------|----------------------|
| **Igneous** | **Solidifies from molten magma or lava**. | Granite, Basalt, Obsidian | Often crystalline; may have visible mineral grains (intrusive) or be glassy (extrusive). |
| **Sedimentary** | **Compaction & cementation of sediments** (particles, shells, organic matter). | Sandstone, Limestone, Shale | Layered (strata); may contain fossils; often softer than igneous rocks. |
| **Metamorphic** | **Transformation of existing rocks** under heat & pressure (without melting). | Marble, Slate, Gneiss | Foliated (layered) or non‑foliated; mineral grains are re‑oriented. |

### How Rocks Form: A Simple Story  

1. **From Fire to Stone (Igneous)**  
   - Deep inside Earth, rocks melt into **magma**.  
   - When magma **cools slowly** underground → large crystals (e.g., granite).  
   - When magma erupts and **cools quickly** on the surface → tiny crystals or glassy texture (e.g., basalt, obsidian).

2. **From Layers to Stone (Sedimentary)**  
   - Wind, water, and ice break down existing rocks into **sediments** (sand, silt, clay).  
   - Over time, layers of sediment **pile up** and get **pressed together** (compaction).  
   - Minerals precipitate from water and **glue** the particles (cementation) → solid rock.

3. **From Pressure to Stone (Metamorphic)**  
   - Existing rocks are **buried** deep in the crust or squeezed between tectonic plates.  
   - **Heat** and **pressure** cause minerals to **re‑arrange** without melting.  
   - New textures develop (e.g., smooth foliation in slate, banding in gneiss).

### Why Knowing Rock Types Matters  

- **Geologists** use rock types to read Earth’s history (e.g., ancient environments, tectonic events).  
- **Engineers** select appropriate rocks for construction (e.g., granite for foundations).  
- **Everyday life**: Your countertop might be made of **granite**, your coffee mug of **ceramic** (derived from fired clay, a sedimentary material).

### Key Takeaways  

- Rocks are **natural solid mixtures of minerals**.  
- The three primary families are **Igneous, Sedimentary, and Metamorphic**.  
- Each family tells a different story about **Earth’s processes**: fire, water, and pressure.
